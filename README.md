In this repo, we refer to the MDP model from https://github.com/TikhonJelvis/RL-book (Ashwin Rao, Tikhon Jelvis) to develop a hedging model for ATM American options. 

The file tdATMAmericanOptionExerciseMDP scripts defines ATM American options as MDP with finite steps and uses backward induction to find the optimal value function and optimal policy at each time step
